*Brief:* This script is made in order to automate writing latex documents for students in software engineering.
*Detail:* A lot of time we spent on lab work report is dedicating to formatting code, screenshot as well as editiing the overall document template. +
The project was born after loosing my link:https://www.office.com/[Office365] acess. I was looking for a better solution to automate my workflow without a cracked version of word. LaTeX came handy since part of the workflow can be automated, the project can be easily shared and versionned with link:https://git-scm.com/[Git] +

== Templates
We provide a template example. The idea behind it is to have to do once the preamble setup and exploit it for usage that are similars. IF you wish to change the default template you can update `TEMPLATE_VERSION` in `constants.py` file.

However we dont explain how to create one or edit it. If you would like to do so please go through the given one and create a pull request to get help.
